I started my coding career when I was 15 years old in high school and gained knowledge in different coding languages, such as: C#, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, JavaScript, and SQL. I am motivated to become a contributing part of the computer science community and keep developing my skills. I always strive to gain knowledge about modern technologies and incorporate them into my own unique projects. Computer Science is my passion and I hope to devote my future education and career to this field.</p>
